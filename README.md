# Sitevision without musarm

## Why? 
Sitevision is many things, but for now, it's not very ergonomic. Short commands are essiential if you are working in a complex system with a lot of menus. 

## What?
This is a [Tampermonkey-script](https://tampermonkey.net/) which provides a small set of short commands for 
- Publishing
- Opening settings for a selected page or template 
- Opening Layout settings for a module
- Opening the Site Properties

To be continued.... Pull requests are welcome. 

## How?
**First of all: Tampermonkey scripts are _always_ used under the users understanding and responsibility. This is not a thing provided by the official [Sitevision](https://sitevision.se) team. I'm just a developer that loves shortcuts and am not found of musarm (google translate that...)***

### Install
- Install Tampermonkey in your Chrome Browser.
- Download a zip of this repo (or cut n'paste fdirectly from the raw file) and create a new Tampermonkey script and paste the code you've just copied. 
- **Change the url** (This is crucial) to `https://your-site.com/*' (and make sure to leave the wildcard)
- Happy "coding"!

### Usage
In combination with the **ctrl-key** (on mac. I have no idea what you PC-guys use) press: 
- **P** Publishing
- **D** Opening settings for a selected page or template 
- **A** Opening Layout settings for a module
- **E** Opening the Site Properties

Memory rule _P for publishing_. The rest is just sortof comfy for my hands. Feel free to change!
